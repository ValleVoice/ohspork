# Searchkick

Search made easy

## Usage

### Searches

Searchkick provides sensible search defaults out of the box. It handles:

- stemming - `tomatoes` matches `tomato`
- special characters - `jalapenos` matches `jalape√±os`
- extra whitespace - `dishwasher` matches `dish washer`
- misspellings - `zuchini` matches `zucchini`

### Zero Downtime Changes

Elasticsearch has a feature called aliases that allows you to change mappings with no downtime.

```ruby
Book.tire.reindex
```

This creates a new index `books_20130714181054` and points the `books` alias to the new index when complete - an atomic operation :)

**First time:** If books is an existing index, it will be replaced by an alias.

Searchkick uses `find_in_batches` to import documents.  To filter documents or eagar load associations, use the `tire_import` scope.

```ruby
class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :tire_import, where(active: true).includes(:author, :chapters)
end
```

There is also a rake task.

```sh
rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Book
```

## Gotchas

### Mappings

When changing the mapping in a model, you must create a new index for the changes to take place.  Elasticsearch does not support updates to the mapping.  For zero downtime, use the `reindex` method above which creates a new index and swaps it in once built. To see the current mapping, use:

```sh
curl http://localhost:9200/books/_mapping
```

### Low Number of Documents

By default, Tire creates an index on 5 shards - even in development.  With a low number of documents, you will get inconsistent relevance scores by default.  There are two different ways to fix this:

- Use one shard

```ruby
settings: {number_of_shards: 1}
```

- Set the search type to `dfs_query_and_fetch`.  More about [search types here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/search-type/).
