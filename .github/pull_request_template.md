Thanks for contributing. Youâ€™re awesome! :heart:

A few things to keep in mind:

- Keep changes to a minimum. If you have multiple features or fixes, submit multiple pull requests.
- Follow the existing style.
- Add one or more tests if possible. Make sure existing tests pass with:

```sh
bundle exec rake test
```
